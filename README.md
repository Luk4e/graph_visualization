# BrowVis

Browser-based big network visualization system. Implemented by Javascript, Emscripten, Pixi.js and Bootstrap technology.

We developed this system to visualize big network in a browser perfroming all the computation (layout+rendering) on the client. 

1) Upload the graph
2) Waiting that the system compute the layout
3) Explore the graph zooming, panning and playing with some parameter.
